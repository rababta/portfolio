      <h1>new Tinder feature</h1>
      <p>For this project, me and my teammates Ana Lizarraga and Jessica Li added a new feature for the Tinder App. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="product-detail">

               <h1>1.</h1>
               <p>First we started by researching our target users and their needs to create a persona that would help us brainstorm ideas
               for a new feature for Tinder. We conducted interviews with many Tinder users and collected data that we can use and created
               a user persona</p>

          </div>
         </div>

         <div class="product-detail">
              <div class="product-info">
                  <h1>2. </h1>
                  <p>Based on the data we collected we decided to work on a new feature called Date Request,
                    in which the user can request to go on a date with their existing match. The feature allows users to plan time,
                  activity and place for the date in a fun and an interactive way. </p>

             </div>

              <img src="img/feature.png" alt="Tinder date request feature" class="product-image">
        </div>

        <div class="product-detail">
              <img src="img/mockup.png" alt="persona" class="product-image">
             <div class="product-info">

                 <h1>3.</h1>
                 <p>Finally, we created the final mockup for the new feature using Figma. We first created wireframes to test the flow of the interaction,
                 and then we were happy with the result, we refined it to match Tinder's style guide and standards. After that, we created a prototype to be tested by users.</p>
