           <h1>1.</h1>
           <p>First we started by interviewing people who adopted a pet, and people who are looking to adopt a pet,
           to understand their needs and concerns, and to try to provide an adoption app that stands out with its unique features.</p>

     <div class="product-detail">
          <div class="product-info">
              <h1>2. </h1>
              <p>After we understood customer needs, we started deciding on the content and layout of app by creating wireframes,
              to test out different ideas and interfaces and decide on one in the end. </p>

             <h1>3.</h1>
             <p>Finally, we created, after user testing, and feedabck from the professor and the teaching assistant, we created the final prototype
             of the app to mimic all the interactions that client might need to do. Everything seemed to run smoothly and we got great feedback. However,
             professor let us know that before making a complete real app in the future, we need to consult a developer to see which features to keep or add. </p>
